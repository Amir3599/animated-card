# Animated Card Component

This repository contains the code for the Animated Card Component, a small project built using React, Next.js, and GSAP.

## Description

The Animated Card Component is a small interactive component that consists of a front and a back side. When the user clicks on the card, it smoothly flips from the front side to the back side, and vice versa. The front side displays basic information, such as a title, a short description, and a button to view more details. The back side displays additional details about the card.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Next.js: A framework for building React applications with server-side rendering, static generation, and more.
- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): A JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations.
